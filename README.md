Brute Force vs Kadane

Contents of the project is found in the following path
algorithmProjectOne/Algo Project One.playground/Contents.swift

Running this on a mac is no problem just click on the file after cloning and it will open up (hopefully) in Xcode. However running on a windows computer has found to become a challenge. There are a few ways to over come this issue.
1. Run some form of macOS on a virtual machine (slows performance)
2. Use swift for windows program via github (doesn't allow timing)
3. use an online playground site created to run swift playgrounds

So going with option 3 copy and paste the code from Contents.swift and paste into the site http://online.swiftplayground.run/ side note when opening site it may display a "lets play" button just click it. There is one minor change that needs to be made though to get this to work. Instead of the orginal import UIKit change to import Foundation on the first line. Once that is done you will be able to run the swift code on a windows computer.
